# NLDR Comparison on Alzheimer MRI

This notebook aims to compare the performance of four Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction (NLDR) techniques: Isometric Mapping (Isomap), Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), Diffusion Maps and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) on an Alzheimer MRI dataset.
They are compared based on four clustering metrics: the Calinski-Harabasz Index, the Davies-Bouldin Index, the Fowlkes-Mallows Index and the Silhouette Score and on the training of a Machine Learning Classifier (Random Forest Classifier) and the assessment of the popular metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1-score.
